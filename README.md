# Deploy the IBM Cloud Starter Kit Collection to OpenShift


The IBM Starter Kit Collection for OpenShift installs new IBM templates into the Developer Catalog for an OpenShift cluster, so developers can easily find and use them. All the templates in this collection run on OpenShift and have the ability to automatically provision and use managed services from the IBM Cloud public catalog.

These starter kits are included in the deployment:
* [Node.js Express App](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-express-app)
* [Go Gin App](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app)
* [Python Flask App](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app)
* [Python Django App](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app)
* [Java Spring App](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app)
* [Node.js + Cloudant App](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-cloudant)
* [Text to Speech Node.js App](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/text-to-speech-code-pattern)
* [Speech to Text Node.js App](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-to-text-code-pattern)
* [Visual Recognition Node.js App](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/visual-recognition-code-pattern)
* [Natural Language Understanding Node.js App](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-understanding-code-pattern)

## Steps
1. [Log in to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login) and [connect to your OpenShift cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-access_cluster).
2. Be sure your cluster has the [IBM Cloud Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/ibmcloud-operator) installed. If it doesn't, have your cluster admin install it.
3. Download and run [this bash script](https://github.com/IBM/starter-kit-collection/blob/master/inventory/ibmcloudEnablement/files/install/install.sh). Be sure make the script executable `chmod +x install.sh`.
4. When the script completes, wait a few minutes and then reload the Developer Catalog in your cluster console.  Filter on publisher 'IBM' to find the newly installed starter kits. 

> **Installation tips:**
> - The new template will appear in the Developer Catalog for the `default` project for your cluster.  You can add the starters to other projects by modifying the install script to include the '-n' flag.  For example, `oc apply -f templates/go-gin-app.json -n test_project` will install the starter in the project named 'test_project', and `oc apply -f templates/go-gin-app.json -n openshift` will install the starter into the cluster Service Catalog.
> - If you would like to uninstall a single starter, you can run the oc delete command from your terminal:  `oc delete -f templates/go-gin-app.json -n test_project`
> - If you would like to uninstall all the starters in the collection, you can download and run the [uninstall script](https://github.com/IBM/starter-kit-collection/blob/master/inventory/ibmcloudEnablement/files/install/uninstall.sh).
